# FUNCTIONS IN A NUTSHELL
What is a function ? We can liken the functions to the furnace. The furnace takes a cake dough and gives us a baked cake. So, we can say that the function is the expression that takes a variable and gives us that variable in another value or the same value. The functions have a variable set and an output set. Every function should have an one output per variable because when function takes a variable, it calculates the output for that variable. Let's express a function that adds 1 to a value of a given variable. 
"""F(x) = x + 1"""
For that example x is the input and x+1 is the output.
## TYPES OF FUNCTIONS
We can seperate types of functions based on element or equation.
### BASED ON ELEMENT FUNCTIONS
#### ONE TO ONE FUNCTION
We said that the functions have only one output per variable. If the values of the functions have an identical output per veriable, we call that function One to One Function.
#### ONTO FUNCTION
If the value set of the function contains every value in the output set, we say it Onto Function. Also the function can be one one and onto function at the same time.
#### CONSTANT FUNCTION
If the function gives a constant for all values, We say it a Constant Function.
### BASED ON EQUATION FUNCTIONS
#### IDENTITY FUNCTION
If the function gives the same value for output per every value, we say it Unit Function. 
#### LINEAR FUNCTION
Linear Function is expressed like f(x) = ax+b, a and b are constants.
#### QUADRATIC FUNCTION
The function that has second-degree equation. f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c where a != 0, b and c are constants.
#### CUBIC FUNCTION
The function has third-degree equation. f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d where a != 0; b,c and d are constants.
#### POLYNOMIAL FUNCTION
That functions has n is a non-negative integer. x is a variable.  f(x) = (a^n)x^n + (a^n-1)x^n-1 + (an-2)x^n-2+ ..... ax + b.
## FUNCTIONS IN REAL LIFE
We are using functions often in Machine Learning(operators for a mobile phone applications.), Basic Economics and Money Math(supply and demand
calculation),Measurement(measuring a temperature).
